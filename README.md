# UnityConventions
This repository aims to compile a complete list of unity best practices and conventions for personal and work usage.

Coding conventions will build upon open sourced unity code and the official .NET conventions.

No matter which conventions you adapt, when working in a team it is highly recommended to talk to the team and agree on some kind of standard.
