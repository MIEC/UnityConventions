# Unity Conventions
Compilation of best practices and conventions for personal and work usage developing games in Unity.

Coding conventions will build upon open sourced unity code and the official .NET conventions, as well as personal insight I gained during development in the past. No matter which conventions you adapt, when working in a team it is highly recommended to talk to the team and agree on some kind of standard.

Although I'm quite happy with the current state I'd love to hear your suggestions on how to further improve the conventions.
